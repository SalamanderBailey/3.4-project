        <h3>What is a neural network?</h3>
        <p>To set some terms straight, a neural network is one popular method of getting machines to learn.
          <br>Some of the techniques used in making a neural network come under 'Deep Learning'.
           <br>Neural networks are revolutionizing the world as we speak.
           <br><br>This site is here to teach you how they work, from the ground up.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The idea of a machine being able to do a human task is called 'Artificial Intelligence'.<br>
          The basis behind neural networks is 'Deep Learning' - that is one popular method of getting a computer to predict an appropriate human response to a task.<br><br>
          Artificial intelligence has a wide range of applications. But, of course in order to know how we can make a computer automate a task for us.
          We need to understand how computers learn, or in a more deeper sense - what learning even is.<br>
          Understanding what learning fundamentally is, and how it happens is imperative to understanding how a neural network functions.
          This first section will attempt to answer this.</p>

        <h3>Let's say you're learning to bake cakes</h3>
        <p>And someone gives you all the right ingredients for some type of cake.
          Maybe they want a sponge cake, maybe they want an ice cream cake, or maybe they just want a cake that's a bit more moist.<br>
          Now, some people might make exact replicas by following recipes - not understanding the reasoning behind anything in the recipe.<br>
          But if you're a good cake maker, you wouldn't just know how to make a cake - you would know the individual steps that turn a cake into what it is.
          You might know, that more flour makes it drier, mixing more creates an 'airy' cake, what makes a cake 'spongy',
          or maybe even something as simple as 'food coloring colors the cake'.<br><br>
          Knowing how to make a cake, is different to knowing how to make 'cakes'.<br><br>
          Following recipes which are given to you to a tee, does not mean you 'know' anything about making a cake.<br>
          Knowing how each ingredient, and step work together to make something more 'spongy', 'dry', or 'fluffy' means you 'know' how to make a cake.<br><br>
          Essentially, all 'knowing' something really means is that you know how every 'some <b>action</b>' on 'some <u>thing</u>' (e.g <b>beating</b> an <u>egg</u>) leads to 'some <i>result</i>'
          <br><br>Knowing every single '<b>action</b> <u>thing</u> <i>result</i>' combination for a task, would mean you fully know how to do said task.
          <br>Learning, is just the process of finding these combinations. </p>

            <p>The image above is a 'function', and it is exactly what we have just described. <br>The 'x' is the '<u>thing</u>',
              the expression on the right is the '<b>action</b>', and whatever the sum of that expression is, is the '<i>result</i>'.<br><br>
              What a function says is that 'doing this to a given input 'x' will give some output'.<br><br>
              If we know the output, and we know the input, then all we have to do is learn what we have to do to those inputs to make it give us this output. </p>
